/**
@title Verifier_Register_Library
@dev Example Verifier Register Library Implementation - to be imported by the verifier registry and other dependent contracts.

This is an example of the storage layout for a Verifier_Register; a register which stores the data of the Verifier_Registry contract.
I've separated these Structs from the main Verifier_Registry, to allow other Register Libraries to be developed over time.

@notice Do not use this example in any production code!
